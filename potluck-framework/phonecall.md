# Potluck Calls
These biweekly calls serve as a way to keep the Public Media Kitchen community up to date with what everyone is working on, thinking about, or planning.  They should occur at the same time every other week and tackle different agendas each time.  Topics can be a more in-depth discussion about things that came up during the Potluck conference, or just things that come during the time between Potlucks.

Be mindful of both West and East coast participants: schedule in a 9am-5pm slot for both zones.  KPCC found that Tuesday 9am PST worked.

The goal of the call is for discussion and not fussing with logistics, so ideally the calls are audio only and don't require video.  If visuals are needed for context, send a link to the visuals beforehand to all the interested parties so that they can view them on their own screen.

## Hosting calls
The hosting group for the upcoming potluck is expected to also host calls leading to the potluck.

## Instructions

### a week before the call
* decide on a topic for the call
* try your best to diversify the talks as much as possible -- keeping them open to devs, designers, PMs, etc.
* recruit 1-3 leaders for the talk (#public-media-kitchen is your best bet)
* send an email to everyone on the contact list (BCC please) with the call topic or agenda
* post an @here message in the #public-media-kitchen slack channel in npr+friends
* if there are specific people you want to lead a talk, send a separate email to them to confirm that they can do it

### a day before the call
* send a reminder email to everyone on the contact list with any updates to the agenda (BCC please)
* send a reminder email to anyone who will be leading a talk and make sure there are links on the etherpad to anything that requires context
* message a @here reminder to the #public-media-kitchen slack channel

### the call
KPCC uses [freeconference.com](https://freeconference.com).  Whatever service you use, make sure to:
* Turn off entry and exit chimes
* Turn off name announce
* Put it in QA mode or some other mode so that everyone except the host is muted by default but participants can unmute themselves.
* Dial into the conference call five minutes beforehand to make sure all audio is set up
* Remind participants of how to unmute (for example, \*6)
* Make sure the designated note-taker is ready on the etherpad
* Make sure the facilitator can see the etherpad for any questions that come up
* At the start of _every call_, be sure to *explicitly and clearly introduce* the PMK, the calls, the role of the calls, the topic, and each speaker (first and last name, org, title).
* In other words, avoid _too much_ informality and any hints of exclusivity and/or clubbiness.
* Before the first speaker, address any housekeeping concerns (e.g., upcoming potluck). Repeat those concerns at the very end of the call.

### after the call
* have the note-taker revise or clean up the notes
* update the [Call Notes Archive](archive/phonecall.html) with a link to the notes
