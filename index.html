        <p>There is too much duplication of effort in public media product development. We can do a better job sharing practices and things we build for ourselves that could be useful to others. The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit is a collection of interesting things we're all working on. The intention is first to inform but over time move to direct collaboration.<br/><br/>

          <p>StreamMachine is an open-source streaming audio server aimed at pushing innovation for radio stations that have spent too many years running old technology like Shoutcast and Icecast.

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiograms</a> A library for generating shareable videos from audio clips</h3>
          <p>Unlike audio, video is a first-class citizen of social media. It's easy to embed, share, autoplay, or play in a feed, and the major services are likely to improve their video experiences further over time. WNYC's solution to this problem was this library. Given a piece of audio to share on social media, this can generate a video with that audio and some basic accompanying visuals: a waveform of the audio, a theme for the show it comes from, and a caption. For more backstory, <a href="https://medium.com/@WNYC/e648e8a5f2e9">read this post</a>.</p>

          <p>At MPR/APM, producers want to include content from tons of third party systems. Many of these support <a href="https://oembed.com/">oEmbeds</a>, a spec for content embedding. To handle these, we built the oEmbed Proxy which is a single place to support first party oembeds (where the provider supports oembeds natively), Embed.ly oembeds (where they built support for a pile of additional content providers), and "Fauxembeds (where we build our own embed providers for sites which do not support it). The oEmbed Proxy is highly extensible and makes it easy to add additional oEmbed providers.</p>
