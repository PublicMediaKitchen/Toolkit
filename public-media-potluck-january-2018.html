        <h1>Public Media Potluck - January 2018 Logistics</h1>
        <p>Build the next generation of Public Media together at the two day "Public Media Potluck". Share ideas, projects, and stories of success and failure with different public media product teams from around the country. Have a bigger impact by tackling issues facing public media organizations of all sizes and types of digital sophistication. This collective, coordinated effort will ensure you're solving problems that benefit more than just "our team", while also reaping the same efficiency benefits from other products and teams. The goal is to stop reinventing the wheel, at every program and station, to work together more, and to share technology.<br/><br/>If you'd like to contact the team organizing the Potluck, the best way to do that is via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/JTtFNbSduotdHGhj2">this form</a>.</p>

          Concentrating on Alexa, each organization should come prepared to answer these questions:

        <ul>
          <li>What skills are we working on?</li>
          <li>What skills do we wish we could work on but can't because of limitations?</li>

          We’re going to divide into two groups: 1.) product designers and product managers, 2.) developers. Within these groups, each person should be prepared to talk about at least one tool <em>and</em> one tip or trick that they use on a daily basis.<br />

          <a href="potluck-framework/archive/etherpad/potluck/potluck-2018-site-overhaul.html">notes</a><br />
          WHYY and KPCC both recently “completed” an overhaul of their website.  Rebecca Smith, Katie Briggs, and Vijay Singh lead the discussion with how they approached their redesigns using a user first design process.  This session will also touch upon CMS interface and data mapping, and establishing a product development process within our organizations.

          <a href="potluck-framework/archive/etherpad/potluck/alexa-skills-potluck-2018.html">notes</a><br />
          Building on learnings from our earlier session about smart speakers, we’re going to build a skill! Anyone who wants to give building a skill a shot should already have an AWS account set up, including the AWS cli tool. Make sure you install the requirements and complete the setup steps prior to this session. <a href="https://github.com/PublicMediaKitchen/alexa-quiz-sample/blob/master/README.md">README</a>

          <strong>Not Just Audio: How to visually jazz up your skill and promote smart speakers</strong><br />
          <a href="potluck-framework/archive/etherpad/potluck/potluck-2018-not-just-audio.html">notes</a><br />
          How do you promote smart speaker skills on a show or audio spot? What are some creative ways to get your skill picked up by users? How can your skill translate to the Amazon Echo Show or Echo Spot? What are some cool ideas that combine visuals with your audio-first skill?
        </p>
        <p><strong>3:30 - 5:00</strong><br />
          <strong>Show me the money!</strong><br/>
          <a href="potluck-framework/archive/etherpad/potluck/potluck-2018-show-me-the-money.html">notes</a><br />
          Most of us are from member-funded organizations. What are some processes that remove friction from the donation process? What are some hurdles to using apple pay for donations? Can people use the Alexa skill to donate? Come prepared to talk about your membership drive process and experiments you’ve tried or would like to try.
        </p>
        <p><strong>5:00 - 5:15</strong><br />

        <h2>Places of Interest</h2>

          <p>KPCC’s offices are in Pasadena, which is conveniently located if you want to check out the city or what the rest of LA has to offer.</p>
          <p>Sticking to this side of town, Old Town Pasadena is a 15 minute walk from the station and has two great independent coffee shops and some decent restaurants.</p>
          <p>A 10 minute Lyft ride away is the Huntington Botanical Gardens (huntington.org) which is a must visit if you want to take advantage of the good weather and have a few hours to kill.</p>
          <p>If you’re willing to drive 20 minutes, you can get to the heart of the San Gabriel Valley, known for its vast array of Chinese restaurants. If you want to explore regional Chinese cuisine, this is where to do it.</p>
          <p>A 30 minute train ride on the Gold line will bring you into downtown LA, straight into a historic train station as well as many walkable spots like Grand Central Market (food hall), Chinatown, and Olvera Street.</p>
